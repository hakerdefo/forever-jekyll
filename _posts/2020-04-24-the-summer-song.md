Summer morning sheds sweet dew  
cloudy window glass  
birds are singing in the trees  
morning music class  

Summer noon scorch marks the skies  
reflection on grass  
butterflies in their crazy moves  
dancing upon flowers  

Summer eve she pains the skies  
hiding dirty scars  
a tired sun at last leaves the scene  
ushering shiny stars
